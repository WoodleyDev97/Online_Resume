<h1>About Me:</h1>
<p>
Hey, I'm Nick! <br />
A passionate coder, seasoned IT professional, lifelong musician, and proud dad of two incredible daughters.
With over a decade in the tech space and hands-on experience wiring everything from homes to high-security infrastructure projects (yep, including Sydney Metro platforms), I bring a rare blend of practical skill and digital finesse to every project I tackle. Whether I'm debugging Python code, rewiring a switchboard, or launching full-stack web apps, I'm driven by the same thing: making systems work better, smarter, and cleaner.
I'm currently deep into the world of full-stack development, balancing Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code Python bootcamp with FreeCodeCamp's full-stack web dev track — all part of my mission to shift gears into a fully remote tech career. I'm relentless when it comes to learning, and I'm aiming to be job-ready within the next 6 to 12 months.
But I'm not just about code and cables.
By night, I shred on the guitar — 20+ years and counting. Music has taught me discipline, creativity, and the importance of listening (skills I carry into every tech stack I work with). I'm also a dedicated gamer, a golf lover, and someone who finds purpose and power in being a present, engaged father.
My life is built on curiosity, craft, and connection — whether it's through writing clean code, crafting a guitar solo, or teaching my daughters how to problem-solve with heart.
If you're looking for someone who's equal parts technical, tenacious, and totally human — welcome to my corner of the internet!
